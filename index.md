## Title: The Lifecycle of Knowledge in Large Language Models: Memorization, Editing, and Beyond

Knowledge is an important prerequisite for various AI applications. It is typically sourced from either structured knowledge sources, such as knowledge bases and dictionaries, or unstructured knowledge sources, such as Wikipedia documents. More recently, researchers have discovered that large language models (FMs) already possess a significant amount of knowledge through pre-training.

Inspired by this, large language models have been used to generate commonsense knowledge and factual knowledge context for question answering. While the results are encouraging, there are still lingering questions: Where does this knowledge come from? How much knowledge do large language models know? Is this knowledge reliable? If some knowledge is wrong, how can we fix it? Our tutorial examines the lifecycle of knowledge within large language models: (1) the emergence of knowledge through foundation model pre-training; (2) injection of external knowledge; (3) the updating and modification of knowledge; (4) probing and generation of knowledge; (5) integration of multimodal knowledge, including physical world understanding and procedural planning. Our target audience are from NLP/AI/ML communities. Audience will learn of a comprehensive review of recent advances and also an in-depth analysis of future directions on the interaction between knowledge and LLMs. Currently, researchers that focus on different stages in this lifecycle are scattered across different sub-communities within machine learning: probing and editing knowledge are often associated with the interpretability track, injecting knowledge is often application-specific and is discussed within the dialog, QA, IE, or summarization tasks, and multi-modal knowledge such as physical world knowledge and procedural planning knowledge is often deliberated by vision and robotics communities. Our tutorial seeks to bring these researchers together and facilitate collaboration to create a more holistic view of the problem.
